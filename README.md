This Scala repository will have all the code that I write to practice Scala Programming, while exploring several features of Scala. As I progress with my Scala skills, I will create new repositories focused at specific tasks based on Scala namely Apache Spark, Akka (Actor Based) programming, Play framework, ScalaNLP  etc.
